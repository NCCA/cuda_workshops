In this workshop you will basically try and improve on the performance of the reduction operator.

I'd expect all of you to try and improve performance at least by eliminating bank conflicts. Plenty of further optimizations are also possible.

This is based on the sample inside of the CUDA examples, so the full solution is lurking in $(CUDA_PATH)/samples/6_Advanced/reduction .
