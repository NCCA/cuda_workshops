In this workshop you will start from scratch, and write an app to add two vectors of floats in both serial and parallel using CUDA.

Given two arbitrary length vectors A and B filled with floats or ints, compute a new vector C which will contain A+B.

Compare the time it takes for your implementation against an equivalent implementation in serial.
