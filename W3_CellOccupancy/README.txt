In this follow on workshop we will determine the total number of points in each grid cell.

You will need to extend the point hash exercise by doing two things:

- Firstly, sort the point data according to cell number (so all point data in a particular cell are next to eachother).

- Next, compute the number of points in each cell.

This is tricksy, so expect difficulty!
